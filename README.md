# **Emotion Detector Analysis**

## **Overview**
The **Emotion Detector Analysis** project is a deep learning-based solution for recognizing facial emotions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By leveraging the **FER-2013 dataset**, this project identifies and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. It also includes performance analysis, model evaluation, and optimization to enhance accuracy.
